### Written activity 1

Students will create a Google Calendar (or Outlook calendar if they prefer) and will add the activities they are planning to do on the following day. They don’t need to alter their calendars if they have one, Google/Outlook lets you create new calendars. Teacher tells students the following information must be on the calendar:

- Wake-up/Bedtimes
- Mealtimes
- Class/Work time
- Homework/Study time
- Physical activity (if applicable)
- Chores (if applicable)

Teacher explains that the students will try to match their actual plans for the next day, but they can use estimates for certain things and modify as needed. Teacher will encourage students to use short sentences such es “Practico yoga” instead of just “yoga.”

### Oral activity 1

Students will work groups of three to plan a *hypothetical* meet up between them. In order to do that, they need to find a time when they will all be available and decide on an activity they could do. They can try to find overlaps and combine their schedules (for instance, if all three of them had homework around the same time, they can do a study group). Afterwards, each group will share what activity they will do and what time that will take place.

**Goals of activity**

- Students will collaborate to schedule an activity together.
