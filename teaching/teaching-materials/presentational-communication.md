![rituales](/assets/ritualescotidianos.jpg){: width="30%" }

For this activity, students will be assigned a text from the book *[Rituales cotidianos. Cómo trabajan los artistas](https://books.google.com/books?id=2ibYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false).* The book contains short texts about the daily rituals of various artists. Each group will prepare a power point presentation about a day in the life of their assigned artistic, using images and short sentences that reference each step. Then, each group will present the power point to the rest of the class, using marcadores temporales and the present tense. This activity has the goal of activating their reading skills as well as having students practicing specific forms. The activity can be adapted to different levels and class objectives.

### Activity 2 - Pet rescue
Teacher follows up on the topics of the previous activity and asks some of the students how did they choose their pet: Did they go to a shelter? Next, teacher explains that, during the pandemic, animal shelters were closed, and many people adopted animals by looking at the shelters’ websites. For this activity, students will work together in groups to create an ad for a pet that’s up for adoption in a local shelter. Each group will receive a picture of a pet and will have to think about the necessary information that needs to go in the ad. They will have to be creative when imagining how that pet is like, since they will only have the picture for reference. Like in the previous activity, the teacher will provide them with some questions that can guide them. Each ad will contain a picture and short sentenced describing the pet. Students will have to think about does the pet likes and doesn’t like (gostar), how does he play (brincar), how they are (como ele é). Each group can choose the format of the ad, it could be PPT slide or a poster from canvas.com, whatever they feel more comfortable with. Afterward, they will share the ads with the class, reading the texts they created, and all the images will be posted on the class Edmodo.

> **Comments:** Websites for animal rescues often function as social media platforms, so this activity can be a fun way expand on the topic without being repetitive. Students can use the skills they practiced during the class to write a short text that could be used in real life. To complete the task effectively, they will need to split the work amongst them and help one another.

### Activity 3
Step 1. Teacher asks students if they have any pets. The slide will have the words for pet (animal de estimação) and some pictures of animals with descriptions (like a picture of a cat with the word “Gato”). For the students that say they have animals, teacher asks them to share the names and what kind. Many of them are not allowed to have pets from living in the dorms, but they might have pets with their family, or they might live in a place that allows pets, and those answers are allowed as well.

Step 2.  Teacher divides students in breakout rooms to ask each other questions about the pets, making sure has at least one pet owner (or former owner). Students will survey each other on the pets they have. If there’s more than one person with a pet in a group, they will choose which one will answer the questions. Teacher provides them with a list of questions they can use, such as “Qual é a cor dele?” “Ele é grande ou pequeno?” “Ele é calmo ou agitado?”.

Step 3. One member from each group will share the pet information with the rest of the class, using sentences like “O gato da Laura é grande, agitado, e a cor dele é laranja.”
