> This is a quiz designed to assess students in a elementary Portuguese class. in particular, the quiz focuses on personal information, places, ser/estar, use of prepositions and transition words. This quiz should reflect content that students had been practicing in the classroom. I have applied a longer version of this quiz to a Portuguese class and the students that kept up with their homework were able to complete the quiz successfully.
