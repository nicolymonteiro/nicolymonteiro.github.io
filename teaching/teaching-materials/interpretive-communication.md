### Activity 1 | Museum Tour

This activity is designed for online learning, but can be applied in in-person settings. First, the class will take a virtual tour of the [Afro Brasil Museum](https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/museu-afro-brasil). The teacher will guide de tour by explaining the purpose of the museum and pointing out the different collections that are available. Then, in groups, students will choose one of the collections to experience together. After looking at the pieces, they will discuss the following questions (in target language):

*Which piece do you like the best? Why?*

*What have you learned from this exhibit?* 

*Did anything surprise you?* 

*What did these pieces make you think of?*

Then, each group will chose one image from the collection to share with the rest of the class, along with their interpretation of it based on their discussions.

### Activity 2 | Online fanfiction

This in a post-viewing activity based on the multiliteracies approach. After watching the film *Bacurau* (Kleber Mendon√ßa Filho and Juliano Dornelles, 2019), each student will pick a character and write  about what happens to the character after the film ends. Bu doing this, the students will align their interpretive skills with the creativity to think about new ways the story could go. This activity can be modified according to the level of the class by changing the requirements for the fanfiction text, which could range from a few sentences to a short story.
