### Written activity 1

![book](/assets/pcbrowsing.jpg){: width="100%" height="100%" }

Students will create a Google Calendar (or Outlook calendar if they prefer) and will add the activities they are planning to do on the following day. They don’t need to alter their calendars if they have one, Google/Outlook lets you create new calendars. They also have the option of using a paper planner if they prefer. Teacher tells students the following information must be on the calendar: Wake-up/Bedtimes, mealtimes, classes, homework and study times, physical activities, chores, etc. Teacher explains that the students will try to match their actual plans for the next day, but they can use estimates for certain things and modify as needed. Teacher will encourage students to use short sentences such es “Practico yoga” instead of just “yoga.” Then, in pairs, students will compare and contrast their daily routines. This activity can be used to have students describing their daily routines, as it helps them to gain vocabulary. 


### Oral activity 1

Students will work groups of three to plan a hypothetical meet up between them. In order to do that, they need to find a time when they will all be available and decide on an activity they could do. They can try to find overlaps and combine their schedules (for instance, if all three of them had homework around the same time, they can do a study group). Afterwards, each group will share what activity they will do and what time that will take place. This activity will have students speaking about their daily routines and they also have a task to solve, which is finding an available time. 

### Written activity 2

This is an exquisite corpse exercise using the format of Twitter. This activity will have the students collectively writing a story on Twitter. Students are divided in groups and each group is assigned a "tweet." The tweet is the first line of a story they have to complete by adding sentences with less than 280 words. Each person in the group will add a tweet that continues the story. At the end, each group will read their story for the rest of the class.

### Oral activity 2

This activity is called "Quem provavelmente," a version of the game "Who's most likely." This activity helps to build community as well as introduce or review vocabulary. Each student is given a handout (they can also access the document on their laptops) and the class is divided in group. First, individually, they have to decide which person from the group is most likely to do each activity listen in the handout. Afterwards, they have to compare and discuss their answers. This is something students will likely be familiar with since it is a common theme on Youtube and other social media platforms. The sentences listed on the handout can be modified to fit different languages, levels, and grammar topics. For instance, in the one above, in Portuguese, I only used regular verbs. I recommend doing an activity like this after the first half of the semester, when the students are more familiar with each other.
