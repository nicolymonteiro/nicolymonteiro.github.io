**Objetives for the day** 

- Students will describe their daily routines

**Warm up**

Students write words related to their daily routines on Jamboard. Then, teacher makes follow-up questions related to the words they wrote.

> Comments: This activity directed student's attention to the theme of the day, which is daily routines. It helps them to start thinking about the things that they to every day, and, because it's o Jamboard, they can see what their classmates have shared. I also asked follow-up questions about the things they put on the boardâ€”For instance, if somebody wrote that they listened to music everyday, I asked what type of music.

**Activity 1** 

Students watch a few minutes from the short-film *Leche,* and then discuss it.  

> Comments: This short film is interesting for students at this level because it relies more on images than the dialogues, so they are able to understand what is happening. The film basically shows 24 hours in the characters' lives, with a sequence at the beginning that contains several clips of daily activities by one of the main characters (making coffee, getting ready for work, etc).
> 

**Activity 2** 

After watching the clip, students do activities from the textbook. The text book lists sentences describes actions by the characters and they had to put them in chronological order.  Afterwards, they provided the answers for the rest of the class.

> Comments: Students were able to easily put the actions in chronological order sine they had just seen the film. The goal of this activity was to introduce them to new vocabulary related to routines. The sentences provided by the book contain words such as "acuesta" and "desayuna," which they will be using frequently in the following weeks.
> 

**Activity 3** 

In pairs, students will ask each other to list a few things they do everyday. Each student will write what their classmate said in chronological order, just like they did in the previous activity with the film.

> Comments: This activity was meant to have students practicing their oral skills with some of the new vocabulary they were introduced to.
> 

**Activity 4** 

Teacher introduces a text about three different Hispanic people who talk about their daily routines. Then, students did activities 16 and 17 from the textbook related to the text. The activities contain questions about the text, asking them to related facts to each person, and also ask them to compare their daily routines with the subjects' daily routines (what do they have in common with them? what is different?

> Comments: I was very happy with the outcome of this activity. Students picked up the new vocabulary quickly and they were able to compare their daily routines with the subjects'. In both activities 3 and 4 most of them were using complete sentences and speaking in Spanish only.
