**Objectives for the day**

- Students will write about a travel experience using the past tense
- Students will use estar + gerundio

**Warm Up** 

The warm up was a grammar activity about marcadores temporales. As can be seen in the power point, students had to fill in the blanks with the correct words. This warm-up was meant to refresh their minds on the marcadores temporales in a way that would help them with the first activity of the day.

**Activity 1**

In this activity, students will write a TripAdvisor review about a hotel. They were divided into four groups, and each group was assigned a pictures of a hotel in the Hispanic world. Collaboratively, they had to write a review by using their imagination and writing as if they had stayed there.  The activity had the purpose of preparing students for their final project of the semester, which was a travel guide. Writing the review helped them to think about vocabulary as well as practicing past tense and marcadores temporales. A challenge that I encountered was that one of the groups was using the past imperfect.

> The activity went well and the students were engaged in the writing process. I pre-selected pictures from places that were different from each other and that were different than regular hotels. The class was divided in four groups according to their sitting positions. The 4th pictures shows a room from a museum, which is actually a formerly abandoned hotel. This one can be difficult for the students, so it was assigned to a group with strong students. They were very imaginative and wrote a detailed negative review.

**Activity 2**

This activity was a quick grammar exercise to introduce them to a new form, which is estar+gerundio. The students had been assigned homework related to this, so the exercised functioned as a complement to that. The reason this came before overt instruction was so they could focus on meaning first.

**Activity 3**

This portion of the class was reserved to an overt instruction on estar + gerundio. The students did not have an issue understanding this form since it is similar to phrasal verbs in English. (be + past participle).

**Activity 4** 

This activity had students using estar+gerundio. First they had to compare their answers to the homework in pairs. Then, they had a few minutes to talk to each other about the following theme: What are you doing now to help you get a job in the future? Afterward, they reported their answers to the rest of the class.
