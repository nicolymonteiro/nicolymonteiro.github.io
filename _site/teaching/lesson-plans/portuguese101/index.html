  <p><strong>Objectives for the day</strong></p>

<p>Students will create an ad for a pet that’s up for adoption; The ad will include a picture and a short text describing the animal with full sentences.</p>

<p><strong>Warm Up</strong></p>

<p>Teacher asks the students what their favorite social media website is, if any (Quem gosta de redes sociais? Alguém não gosta de redes sociais?). Teacher also asks students what they like to do on the internet besides social media (watching videos, shopping, reading the news, etc). Teacher also reminds students that, in Brazil, many words in English are used when talking about the internet, such as internet, likes, and site, but with a different pronunciation.</p>

<p><strong>Activity 1</strong></p>

<p>Teacher will introduce the topic of social media and personal characteristics, and how we will often reflect our personality through our posts. Then, the teacher will ask students to work together in groups to “curate” an Instagram/Facebook page according to a list of characteristics. Each group will receive a list with a name and some adjectives, from which they will choose three pictures they imagine would go on that person’s online page. For instance, if they are given the words “Extrovertido” (Extrovert) “Aventureiro” (Outdoorsy) and “Engraçado,” (Funny) they might choose pictures of a hiking trail and a meme. Afterward, each group will share the adjectives they were assigned and the pictures they chose with the rest of the class. They will be encouraged to use complete sentences when sharing, such as “Joao é aventureiro, extrovertido e engraçado.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Comments:</strong> This is an activity I would do to help them revise adjectives they have learned in previous classes and learn some new ones. The teacher needs to check in with each group to make sure they understand the meanings of the adjectives. This activity allows students to add visuals to the words they are studying</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Activity 2</strong></p>

<p>Step 1. Teacher tells students they are going to watch a few minutes from a vlog on Youtube (https://youtu.be/I-3HNGAaJXw). In the vlog, the influencer is showing what a productive day in their lives looks like. The vlog does not have dialogues and consists mostly of images with the occasional caption in Portuguese. Images include a girl waking up early, eating breakfast, and studying. Then, teacher asks students to think about things that they like to do on their daily lives.</p>

<p>Step 2. Students will play a game of “O que você prefere” (“Would you rather”) on Flipgrid. Teacher tells students they have to pick which activities they would rather do. The phrases will contain simple sentences of activities they might like to do, with pictures related to that activity. “Would you rather wake up early or sleep in?” “Would you rather read a book or go on a hike?” “Drink coffee or tea?” and so on. They will write their names under their preferred options, so it will be possible to see what activities are more popular amongst the class.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Comments:</strong> Since the activities before and after requiring a lot of collaboration, I wanted to “break” the class with a more relaxed activity. By watching the vlog, they will start connecting the vocabulary they have been learning with activities they usually do, and by playing the game they can further connect it to their lives. On Flipgrid, each activity has a descriptive picture, so the students will be able to identify them when they don’t have the vocabulary. This activity will also provide them with authentic material from a Brazilian influencer, expanding their views on culture.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Activity 3</strong></p>

<p>Step 1. Teacher asks students if they have any pets. The slide will have the words for pet (animal de estimação) and some pictures of animals with descriptions (like a picture of a cat with the word “Gato”). For the students that say they have animals, teacher asks them to share the names and what kind. Many of them are not allowed to have pets from living in the dorms, but they might have pets with their family, or they might live in a place that allows pets, and those answers are allowed as well.</p>

<p>Step 2.  Teacher divides students in breakout rooms to ask each other questions about the pets, making sure has at least one pet owner (or former owner). Students will survey each other on the pets they have. If there’s more than one person with a pet in a group, they will choose which one will answer the questions. Teacher provides them with a list of questions they can use, such as “Qual é a cor dele?” “Ele é grande ou pequeno?” “Ele é calmo ou agitado?”.</p>

<p>Step 3. One member from each group will share the pet information with the rest of the class, using sentences like “O gato da Laura é grande, agitado, e a cor dele é laranja.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Comments</strong>: This activity works on the interpersonal level by having students share information about their pets. It will also prepare them for the next activity, which is a little more complex.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Activity 4</strong></p>

<p>Teacher follows up on the topics of the previous activity and asks some of the students how did they choose their pet: Did they go to a shelter? Next, teacher explains that, during the pandemic, animal shelters were closed, and many people adopted animals by looking at the shelters’ websites. For this activity, students will work together in groupsto create an ad for a pet that’s up for adoption in a local shelter. Each group will receive a picture of a pet and will have to think about the necessary information that needs to go in the ad. They will have to be creative when imagining how that pet is like, since they will only have the picture for reference. Like in the previous activity, the teacher will provide them with some questions that can guide them. Each ad will contain a picture and short sentenced describing the pet. Students will have to think about does the pet likes and doesn’t like (gostar), how does he play (brincar), how they are (como ele é). Each group can choose the format of the ad, it could be PPT slide or a poster from canvas.com, whatever they feel more comfortable with. Afterward, they will share the ads with the class, reading the texts they created, and all the images will be posted on the class Edmodo.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Comments:</strong> Websites for animal rescues often function as social media platforms, so this activity can be a fun way expand on the topic without being repetitive. Students can use the skills they practiced during the class to write a short text that could be used in real life. To complete the task effectively, they will need to split the work amongst them and help one another.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Wind down/Wrap up</strong></p>

<p>Teacher reminds students that all the pets they discussed are up for adaptation and they go and look at the real profiles in the organization websites and compare with what they wrote, and they can also share them social media if they feel like it, since that might help the pets to find their homes.</p>
