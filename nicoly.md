# Things I Do

## ü•ë Developer Relations

As a developer, educator, and community builder, Developer Relations holds a close space to my heart. There's a certain kind of ‚ú®**magic** in supporting creators, be that at a 1:1 or 1:many scale. 

Every developer you encounter poses an opportunity to learn and improve the way you deliver content/educate, ultimately impacting millions of end-users. 

That's pretty damn cool.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Community Building

Peer learning is a **powerful force multiplier** for any skill; by creating communities, you indirectly create new relationships, improve products, and improve accessibility. 

Having grown communities at a personal + corporate level, I have been able to see many of these benefits first-hand over the years.
