<p>As a graduate student, I am constantly looking for ways to develop my research and teaching skills, so this is a work in progress. You can learn more about my teaching experience here, as I am currently sharing my experience teaching Portuguese and Spanish.  And everything research related is hereâ€”I am interested in Latin American film and its intersection with politics, anthropology and class relations. </p>
